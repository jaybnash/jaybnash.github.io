  <p>
    I am an undergraduate at <a href="https://www.conncoll.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Connecticut College</a>, double majoring in <a href="https://www.conncoll.edu/academics/majors-departments-programs/departments/computer-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://www.conncoll.edu/academics/majors-departments-programs/departments/physics-astronomy-and-geophysics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Physics</a>. While Iâ€™m not reading science fiction novels or playing Dungeons and Dragons, I spend my time working on machine learning models and non-deterministic simulations in the <a href="https://oak.conncoll.edu/parker/research.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Autonomous Agent Learning Lab</a>. You can view my published work <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mporz1gAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. In my professional life, I work as a network administrator and help desk technician for the <a href="https://www.conncoll.edu/library-information-technology/technology-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Connecticut College IT Department</a>, where I am currently working on standing up a student-led security operations center.

# Research Introduction
research_intro: |
  <p>
  My research is primarily focused on, but not limited to game-playing AI, concensus mechanisms, robotic gaits, and evolutionary dynamics. Most recently I've been investigating possible alternative policy frameworks specifically suited to dertivative-free optimization. I'm currently working on my honors thesis on playing nethack with a learned policy.
