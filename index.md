While Iâ€™m not reading science fiction novels or playing Dungeons and Dragons, I spend my time working on machine learning models and non-deterministic simulations in the <a href="https://oak.conncoll.edu/parker/research.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Autonomous Agent Learning Lab</a>. You can view my published work <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mporz1gAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. In my professional life, I work as a network administrator and help desk technician for the <a href="https://www.conncoll.edu/library-information-technology/technology-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Connecticut College IT Department</a>, where I am currently working on standing up a student-led security operations center.
