  <p>
  I am an undergraduate at [Connecticut College](https://www.conncoll.edu/), double majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.conncoll.edu/academics/majors-departments-programs/departments/computer-science/) and [Physics](https://www.conncoll.edu/academics/majors-departments-programs/departments/physics-astronomy-and-geophysics/). While I'm not reading science fiction novels or playing Dungeons and Dragons; I spend my time working on machine learning models and non-deterministic simulations in the [Autonomous Agent Learning Lab](https://oak.conncoll.edu/parker/research.html). You can view my published work [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mporz1gAAAAJ&hl=en). In my professional life, I work as a network admistrator and help desk technician for the [Connecticut College IT Department](https://www.conncoll.edu/library-information-technology/technology-services/), where I am currently working on standing up a student led security operations center.
